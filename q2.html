	  President Trump’s executive order suspending the entire resettlement program for 120 days and banning indefinitely 
	  the arrival of Syrian refugees is a repudiation of fundamental American values, an abandonment of the United States’ role 
	  as a humanitarian leader and, far from protecting the country from extremism, a propaganda gift to those who would plot harm to America.

	 The order also cuts the number of refugees scheduled for resettlement in the United States in the fiscal year 2017 from a planned total 
	 of about 110,000 to just 50,000. Founded on the myth that there is no proper security screening for refugees, the order thus thrusts into 
	 limbo an estimated 60,000 vulnerable refugees, most of whom have already been vetted and cleared for resettlement here. The new policy urgently 
	 needs rethinking.

	 In 1980, when Congress passed the Refugee Act with bipartisan support, President Carter’s secretary of Health, 
	 Education and Welfare, Joseph A. Califano Jr., said the refugee issue required the United States to “reveal to the world 
	 — and more important to ourselves — whether we truly live by our ideals or simply carve them on our monuments.”
     That still resonates today. Expert review of the resettlement vetting process is part of good government. 
	 Hasty dismissal of carefully developed systems is harmful in and of itself. It is also a distressing departure from fact-based 
	 policy making.

	 The world looks to America for enlightened leadership. Its citizens seek the same from their government. 
	 Refugee policy is a telling test for every nation. The United States passed that test for so many years, 
	 so it is a tragedy for it now to fail when its commitment is needed more than ever.
